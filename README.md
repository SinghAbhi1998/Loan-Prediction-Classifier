# Loan-Prediction-Classifier
Build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.
load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. 
use the following algorithms to build models:
k-Nearest Neighbour
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine
Logistic Regression
The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

Jaccard index
F1-score
LogLoass
